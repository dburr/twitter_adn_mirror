# Twitter to App.net Crossposter
### by Donald Burr <dburr@borg-cube.com>

## Purpose




I simply don't have [over 9,000 hours in the day][OVER9000] to manage all these
social networks, nor do I have the patience to do so.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this script, you will need to install the following
Python modules, as well as their prerequisites.  Consult their Github
pages for instructions on how to do so.

* [Python-Twitter][PYTHON-TWITTER]
* [Python App.net API Wrapper][PYTHON-APPDOTNET]

## Setup

Once those are installed, take a look at config.sample, copy it and
edit, then get your Twitter and App.net API keys.
